# Sentiment-Analysis-Airlines
The objective of the work is to process the data using Natural language tool kit and  Regular expression libraries as well as develop a logistics regression model and decision tree model. The code required knowledge of data science as well as basic machine learning to achieve the goals.

## Data
The following dataset has 14640 tweets containg information about the place , time, persons name as well as the text of the tweet as the data samples which are trained to predict the mood/ sentiment of the tweeter. In total, we have 14 features and 14640 training tweets.

Moods has been classifed into Positive, Neutral and Negative, the code needs to classify among these classes.

## Code
The following code has been prepared in the google colab and has been advised to use the same platfrom. The code starst with reading the data, visualizing the data and later on preprocessing it, to be fit for classification models. The last stage, develops a logistic classification and decision tree model to classify the sentiments.

The code used regular expression (re) and natural langugae tool kit (nltk) to deal with text data. The input data is visualized in form of tf-idf frequency matrix using the appropriate module.
The code takes the kaggle data as the input file which has been uploaded in the github directory along with the results of the code.
